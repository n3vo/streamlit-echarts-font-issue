# Introduction
Hello everyone! I'm working on a simple bar chart using streamlit-echarts and I'm having trouble changing the font. Despite my efforts, the chart doesn't seem to pick up the font specified in my CSS. Other Streamlit features like `st.write` apply the font correctly without any issues.
I set the `renderer` to 'svg' intentionally, because i saw it's suppose to work better than 'canvas' as explain in this thread:

# Required Information
1. Are you running your app locally or is it deployed?
   
   **Locally**

2. Share the link to your app's public GitHub repository:
   
   **[Link To Repository]**

3. Share the full text of the error message (not a screenshot):
   
   **There are no specific error messages, only warnings.**

4. Share the Streamlit and Python versions:
   - **Streamlit version: 1.34.0**
   - **Python version: 3.10.4**

Any insights on how to get the chart to recognize the font from the CSS would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!
